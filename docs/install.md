Installation is as simple as:

```bash
pip install devtools[pygments]
```

`pygments` is not required but if it's installed, output will be highlighted and easier to read.

`devtools` has no other required dependencies except python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8.
If you've got python 3.6+ and `pip` installed, you're good to go.
